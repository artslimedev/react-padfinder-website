## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

This was a project I took on as one of my first React applications. It is a front-end design of a real estate agency firm's website. The site was built using HTML & CSS implimented in the form of using the React library. Each section of the page is built using the components framwork and incorporating HTML into JSX. I imported each component as well as all the assets into the proper directories. I also imported and used React-Icons in the UI. Using NodeJS I installed the proper packages for react-icons as well as react itself. Once the project was completed I once again used Node to run my script and build my application for deployment.

## Lessons Learned:

React is quickly becoming one of my favorite wasy to design and build web applications. I am thoroughly enjoying breaking down every part of an application into components and the train of thought which comes along with it. This project is one that helped me familiarize myself with organizing and importing different pieces of the site as components. This has allowed me to think through how to stack each building block to complete the application.
